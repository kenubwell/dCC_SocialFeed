This was a React project for devCodeCampâ€™s Full Stack Developers bootcamp program. It was designed to familiarize myself with React.js best practices, and deep dive into components and how they interact within the entire application. This primarily entailed creating a form component that allows a user to create new posts (e.g. social feed).

Technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

Resources: Regular Functions vs. Arrow Functions, Intro to React.js, Importing in React (Lecture)

The following is an image of my Social Feed:
